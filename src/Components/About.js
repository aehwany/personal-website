                            I was born and raised in Cairo, Egypt. Growing up, I used to travel a lot with my family, 
                            where I got to experience a variety of cultures, languages and most importantly food from around the world.
                            Therefore, I developed an appreciation and taste for pretty much everything new!
                            As I prepare to embark on this next chapter of my life, I hope this website can act as a brief summary of 
                            what I've done with my time (professionally and not) so far!
